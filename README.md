# Natsu Framework

Natsu, formerly [Yoru Engine](https://github.com/nebula-developer/yoru-engine) is a platform-agnostic game/application framework written in C#. It is designed to be lightweight, modular, and flexible for different use cases (e.g. software, games, simulations, etc).

### Features

- **Interface-driven**: Natsu was designed with the idea of providing effortless integration with a variety of platforms. By leveraging interfaces, it abstracts platform-specific functionality, allowing developers to focus on their application logic without worrying about the underlying platform (e.g., web, mobile, desktop, or backend).

- **Extensibility**: Natsu framework's modular architecture enables easy customization and expansion. By extending Natsu's base functionality, developers can create a specialized set of components tailored to a per-project basis.

### Platforms

- **Desktop**: Through the use of [OpenTK](https://opentk.net/), Natsu can be used to build high-performance desktop applications for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Mobile** (coming soon): Natsu can be used to build mobile applications for iOS and Android using [MAUI](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/maui).
- **Web** (coming soon): Web applications can make Natsu even more flexible through the use of [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor), [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/), and [SkiaSharp](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp).
